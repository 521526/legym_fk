Explanation:

    Register activities.

Argument:

    activity 1,
    activity 2,
           ...: Optional.
                Name of activity you want to register, in Chinese.
                You can specify several activities at a time.
                If not specified, we will register the first
                available activity for you.

Example:

    >>> reg 第三空间清水河校区综训馆
    第三空间清水河校区综训馆：报名成功

    >>> reg 第三空间沙河校区体育场
    第三空间沙河校区体育场：已签到该活动

Note:

    We are OK with abbreviation of activity, e.g. "综训馆" for
    "第三空间清水河校区综训馆", as long as it is a substring of full name,
    and does not cause ambiguity. If your abbreviation leads to
    unexpected results, e.g. registering an activity that cannot be
    signed in, this program and its authors assume no responsibility.
